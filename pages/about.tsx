          How many startups are there in Chiang Mai?
        </Typography>
      </Box>
      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
        No one seems to know how many startups there are in Chiang Mai, much less how many 
        of those are investable businesses. Are these startups only Thai-focused or do they 
        have global potential? Are there any ventures founded by the city's huge community 
        of digital nomads that are worth knowing about?
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
        The questions abound, but the answers are hard to find (especially in English).

        By building a directory of all the startups in Chiang Mai, this project aims to provide 
        insight into the local ecosystem and kickstart connections and opportunities.
